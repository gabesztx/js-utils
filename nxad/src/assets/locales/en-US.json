You could, for example, copy them from a list prepared in a text file into the text box here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <strong>Attention!</strong>\n\n Always make sure that your email addresses are properly separated. There are two ways to do this: E-mail addresses must be separated by comma or enter. The following table lists the correct separation methods.\n</p>\n\n<table>\n <tr>\n <th>Separator</th>\n\n <th>Example</th>\n </tr>\n\n <tr>\n <td>Comma</td>\n\n <td>\n abc@gmail.com,cba@gmail.com,xyz@gmail.com\n </td>\n </tr>\n\n <tr>\n <td>Enter</td>\n\n <td>\n abc@gmail.com\n\n <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>\n\n <br>\n cba@gmail.com\n\n <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>\n\n <br>\n xyz@gmail.com\n </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n 2. In the box\n\n <strong>\"Add list of recepients\"</strong>\n\n you also have the option to upload e-mail addresses in CSV formatte files containing many e-mail addresses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n This may be an obvious solution if the students' e-mail addresses, for example, are available in an Excel file. Save the student's email address from Excel in CSV format. Then click the \"Upload file\" button, select the CSV file in the popup window, and then click the \"Open\" button.\n</p>",
